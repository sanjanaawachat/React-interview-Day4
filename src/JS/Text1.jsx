            Ans-
            <p>The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application. (or) Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.
